    <h2>BIODEGRADEABLE</h2>
   <p>Biodegradable waste refers to any organic material that can be broken down naturally by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and other living organisms. This process, known as decomposition, returns the waste to the soil, enriching it with nutrients and helping to maintain the ecosystem's balance. Common examples of biodegradable waste include food scraps, paper, yard trimmings, and natural fibers like cotton or wool. Unlike non-biodegradable materials, which can persist in the environment for years, biodegradable waste decomposes relatively quickly, making it a more environmentally friendly option. Proper management of biodegradable waste, such as composting, not only reduces landfill use but also helps in soil fertility and reduces methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas produced in landfills from organic waste.</p>
